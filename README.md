needs.

## Getting Started

To begin using these configuration templates:

1. Install Recyclarr if you haven't already. Refer to the [official documentation][1] for
   installation instructions.
2. Use the `config create` command to generate local copies of templates that you can customize. See
   the [CLI Reference][2] for detailed command usage.
3. Each template requires you to provide values for the [`base_url` and `api_key` properties][3].
4. For a deeper understanding of template components and customization options, consult the
   [Configuration YAML Reference][4].
